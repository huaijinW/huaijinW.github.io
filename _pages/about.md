I am a Ph.D student at the Group IRA2, laboratory [IBISC](https://www.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/), Université d'Evry Paris Saclay, supervised by Khalifa Djemal(IBISC, Université d'Evry Paris Saclay), and Amir-Ali Feiz(LMEE, Université d'Evry Paris Saclay).

My thesis is : "_Deep active learning for the identification and geolocation of air pollution sources in urban areas_".

My research
======
Nowadays, the prediction of air pollution concentration with a known source, as a direct problem in environmental science domain, has already been well developped with the Machine learning, even the Deep learning technique. But, the inverse problem, to identify the source position of the air pollutant, is always weakly positioned.
Thanks to Doctor Sidi-Mohammed Alaoui, whose research is about to optimize the sensor network in an atmospherical experiment campaign, I pursue to develop a **Active Deep learning** method to find out the unknown source position.
