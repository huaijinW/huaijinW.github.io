#Abstract: Nowadays, urban pollution continuously impacts people's daily lives. The identification and geolocation of pollution sources have become increasingly important. However, the detected pollutant data suffers from the experimental environment and conditions, making it challenging for models to accurately extract meaningful information and generate reliable predictions. To address these issues, data augmentation emerges as a crucial technique for enhancing training datasets in machine learning, especially for the sparse and noisy spatiotemporal air pollution data. In this study, we propose a hybrid method combining  Auto-Regressive Iterated Moving-Average (ARIMA) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to interpolate missing spatiotemporal data, and we implement another method, Iterated Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (ISMLR), which enriches the dataset by adding more explanatory variables, to compare with the hybrid method. To evaluate the effectiveness of these augmentation strategies, we employ two machine learning models: Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The experimental results indicate that both data augmentation methods slightly improve model performance, confirming their suitability for augmenting spatiotemporal contaminated data.
